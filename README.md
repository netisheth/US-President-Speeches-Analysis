# US-President-Speeches-Analysis

Data:
- Created a corpus of inaugural speeches of all US Presidents, available from the Miller Center's website (https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-speeches. It can also be extracted from NLTK's "inaugural" corpus. 
- Added to the corpus the year of the speech and the presidentâ€™s party affiliation ( Democratic, Republican, Other)

Analyzed the textual content of these speeches to answer the following questions:

1. Which president has the most vocabulary as evident from their inaugural speeches, and which presidents has the least vocabulary? On average, do Democratic, Republican, or Other presidents have higher vocabulary?

2. Visualization - Create a barplot of presidential vocabulary from the earliest president (Washington) to the latest (Trump) in this sample of presidential speeches. Color code this barplot as blue for Democrats, red for Republican, and gray for Others.

3. What are the five most frequently used words (exclusive of stop words) used by each president? Do Democratic presidents use a different set of words than Republican presidents? 

4. What is the sentiment (positive/negative) for each president? Which of these groups have higher mean sentiment score? Who are the top three presidents with the highest positive sentiment in each group?
